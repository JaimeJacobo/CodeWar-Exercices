INSTRUCTIONS:

If you're faced with an input box, like this:

                                           +--------------+
  Enter the price of the item, in dollars: |              |
                                           +--------------+
do you put the $ sign in, or not? Inevitably, some people will type a $ sign and others will leave it out. The instructions could be made clearer - but that won't help those annoying people who never read instructions anyway.

A better solution is to write code that can handle the input whether it includes a $ sign or not.

So, we need a simple function that converts a string representing a number (possibly with a $ sign in front of it) into the number itself.

Remember to consider negative numbers (the - sign may come either before or after the $ sign, if there is one), and any extraneous space characters (leading, trailing, or around the $ sign) that the users might put in. You do not need to handle trailing characters other than spaces (e.g. "1.2 3"). If the given string does not represent a number, (either with or without a $ sign), return 0.0 .



MY SOLUTION:

money_value = ((s)=>{
  let comparativeArray = [];
  for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++){
    if(s[i] >= 0 || s[i] === '.'){
      comparativeArray.push(s[i]);
    };
  };
  comparativeArray = comparativeArray.join();
  for(let i = 0; i < comparativeArray.length; i++){
    if(comparativeArray[i] >= 0) comparativeArray = comparativeArray.replace(',', '');
  };
  comparativeArray = Number(comparativeArray);
  for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++){
    if(s[i].indexOf('-')!== -1){
      comparativeArray = '-' + comparativeArray;
    };
  };
  return comparativeArray;
});
