INSTRUCTIONS:

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

Examples
[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
Should return: 11 (the only odd number)

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
Should return: 160 (the only even number)







MY SOLUTION:

let findOutlier = ((numbersInt)=>{
  let countForOdds = new Array();
  let countForEvens = new Array();
  for(let i = 0; i < numbersInt.length; i++){
    if(numbersInt[i] % 2 == 0){
      countForEvens.push(numbersInt[i]);
    } else if(numbersInt[i] % 2 != 0){
      countForOdds.push(numbersInt[i]);
    };
  };
  console.log(countForOdds)
  console.log(countForEvens)
  if(countForOdds.length == 1){
    return countForOdds[0];
  } else if(countForEvens.length == 1){
    return countForEvens[0];
  };
});
